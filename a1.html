        Chicken karahi, or kadai chicken, is a chicken dish from South Asia. It is known as gosht karahi when prepared with goat
        or lamb meat instead of chicken.
        
        The dish is prepared in a karahi (a type of wok) and can take between 30 and 50 minutes to prepare and cook the
        dish.[1][2] Ginger, garlic, tomatoes, green chilli and coriander are key to the flavor of the dish.[3] What
        distinguishes chicken karahi from other curries from the region is that traditionally, it is cooked without onions in
        the base, and instead uses just tomatoes, ginger and garlic.
